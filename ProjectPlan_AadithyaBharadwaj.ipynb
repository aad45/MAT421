It has been integrated with several common use applications in our devices such as background removal in photos, object recognition, as well as use cases in Augmented Reality. With the increasing demand for real-time processing on mobile devices, companies have began to ramp us Image segmentation model's such as the newly announced Meta Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), or DeepLabV3+; both optimizing deep learning models for efficiency while also making advancements in accuracy. This project plan demonstrates the aim and need for the project to explore and evaluate pre trained image segmentation models optimized for mobile devices, by analyzing their performance in measures of speed, accuracy, efficiency as well as processing costs and storage costs.\n"
